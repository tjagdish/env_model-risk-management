Critical models may require more frequent and deeper review, while lower-risk models can follow a lighter cadence. Material changes trigger revalidation before continued use.", "info": {"required_citations": ["[SR11-7]", "[OCC-Handbook]"], "tags": ["validation", "governance"], "difficulty": "medium"}}
